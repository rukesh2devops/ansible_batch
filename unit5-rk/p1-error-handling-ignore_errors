  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
   - name: check status of a service which is already made it in stopped mode knowly
     command: systemctl is-active chronyd
     register: xyz
     ignore_errors: yes

## playbook was not going ahead since service was down and ansible was getting understand that it is error and got failed hence we have used "ignore_errors" to ignore this and run the playbook ahead.
   
  
   - debug:
       var: xyz
   
   - name: start the service if found in stop mode
     service:
       name: chronyd
